# DJ Hersh's Web Developer Portfolio

This is a webpage designed to be the home of all the work I will accomplish in the UCLA Extension Full-Stack Web Developer Coding Bootcamp. It will showcase the projects I will have worked on and completed by the end of the course.

I want to use this portfolio to potentially gain employment within the web development field.

I created this webpage largely using Bootstrap, so that it will be responsive no matter what size screen you are viewing it on.
