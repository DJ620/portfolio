# DJ Hersh's Web Developer Portfolio

## Description

This is a webpage designed to be the home of all the work I will accomplish in the UCLA Extension Full-Stack Web Developer Coding Bootcamp. It will showcase the projects I will have worked on and completed by the end of the course.

I want to use this portfolio to potentially gain employment within the web development field.

## Credits

First, I must credit the UCLA Extension Full-Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp, Bryan Swarthout, and Wilson Lam for introducing me to the resources I utilized in making my portfolio.

I created this webpage largely using Bootstrap, so that it will be responsive no matter what size screen you are viewing it on.

I also used the website CSS-Tricks to learn about how to implement more styling techniques I was interested in using, such as setting up linear gradients for backgrounds and text, and to add text-shadow.
